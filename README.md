# Verana Trust Resolver (VerRe)

The **Verana Trust Resolver** library provides a set of functions to resolve Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), validate their associated documents, process Verifiable Credentials, and check their trust status according to the [**Verifiable Trust** specifications](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-spec/#vt-json-schema-cred-verifiable-trust-json-schema-credential) of the Verana blockchain.

The main entry point for using the resolver is the `resolve` function, which allows users to retrieve and validate a DID document, process its credentials, and check its trust status against the **Verana Trust Registry**.

## **Getting Started**

To use the Verana Trust Resolver, install the library and import the necessary modules:

```bash
npm install @verana-labs/verre
```
or
```bash
yarn add @verana-labs/verre
```

## Overview
The `resolve` method is used to resolve a Decentralized Identifier (DID), validate its associated document, and verify any linked services. This function retrieves the DID document, processes its verifiable credentials, and determines its trust status.

## Importing the Method
```typescript
import { resolve } from '@verana-labs/verre';
```

## Method Signature
```typescript
async function resolve(did: string, options?: ResolverConfig): Promise<TrustResolution>
```

## Parameters

- `did` (**string**, required): The Decentralized Identifier (DID) to resolve.

- `options` (**ResolverConfig**): Configuration options for the resolver.
  - `trustRegistryUrl` (**string**, optional): The URL of the trust registry used to validate the DID and its services.
  - `didResolver` (**Resolver**, optional): A custom [universal resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) instance. Useful when integrating with specific resolution strategies, such as those from Credo-TS.
  - `agentContext` (**AgentContext**, mandatory): holds the global operational context of the agent, including its current runtime state, registered services, modules, dids, wallets, storage, and configuration from Credo-TS
> **Note:** This function internally uses additional fields (like `attrs`) for recursion and processing, which are not part of the public configuration interface.

## Return Value
Returns a `Promise<TrustResolution>` that resolves to an object containing:

- `resolvedDidDocument` (**ResolvedDidDocument**, optional): The resolved DID document.
- `metadata` (**TrustResolutionMetadata**, required): Metadata related to the resolution, including possible states and error codes.
  - `content`
  - `status`
  - `errorCode`
- `verifiableService` (**Record<string, string>**, optional): The entity that provided the credential.
- `issuerCredential` (**Record<string, string>**, optional): A record indicating the approved issuer.
- `type` (**ECS**, optional): The type of resolved entity, representing essential credentials.

## Usage Example
```typescript
(async () => {
  try {
    const did = 'did:example:123456';
    const options = { trustRegistryUrl: 'https://trust-registry.example.com' };
    
    const resolution = await resolve(did, options);
    
    console.log('Resolved DID Document:', resolution.resolvedDidDocument);
    console.log('Trust Metadata:', resolution.metadata);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error resolving DID:', error);
  }
})();
```

### Using Credo-TS with a Custom or Default DID Resolver

```ts
import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'
import { AgentContext } from '@credo-ts/core'

// Set up the agent
const agent = await setupAgent({ name: 'Default DID Resolver Test with Credo' })
const agentContext = agent.dependencyManager.resolve(AgentContext)

// Use the custom resolver in the call to `resolve`
// By default, if no resolver is provided, the Credo-TS resolver will be used
await resolve('did:web:example.com', {
  trustRegistryUrl: 'https://registry.example.com',
  agentContext,
})
```

### Using Credo-TS to Provide a Custom DID Resolver

```ts
import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'
import { DidResolverService, AgentContext } from '@credo-ts/core'

// Set up the agent
const agent = await setupAgent({ name: 'DID Service Test' })
const didResolverService = agent.dependencyManager.resolve(DidResolverService)
const agentContext = agent.dependencyManager.resolve(AgentContext)

// Create a custom resolver using Credo-TS resolution strategies
const didResolver = new Resolver({
  web: async (did: string) => didResolverService.resolve(agentContext, did),
  key: async (did: string) => didResolverService.resolve(agentContext, did),
  peer: async (did: string) => didResolverService.resolve(agentContext, did),
  jwk: async (did: string) => didResolverService.resolve(agentContext, did),
})

// Use the custom resolver in the call to `resolve`
await resolve('did:web:example.com', {
  trustRegistryUrl: 'https://registry.example.com',
  didResolver,
  agentContext,
})
```

### âœ… Example: Agent with In-Memory Askar Wallet and DID Resolver (Credo-TS)

```ts
import { Agent, AgentContext, InitConfig } from '@credo-ts/core'
import { AskarModule } from '@credo-ts/askar'
import { agentDependencies } from '@credo-ts/node'
import { ariesAskar } from '@hyperledger/aries-askar-nodejs'
import { Resolver } from 'did-resolver'

import { getAskarStoreConfig } from '../src/helpers'

// Create the in-memory wallet config
const walletConfig = getAskarStoreConfig('InMemoryTestAgent', { inMemory: true })

// Agent initialization config
const config: InitConfig = {
  label: 'InMemoryTestAgent',
  walletConfig,
}

// Create and initialize the agent
const agent = new Agent({
  config,
  dependencies: agentDependencies,
  modules: {
    askar: new AskarModule({ ariesAskar }),
  },
})

await agent.initialize()

// Resolve dependencies
const agentContext = agent.dependencyManager.resolve(AgentContext)

// Example usage of the DID Resolver
const result = await resolve('did:web:example.com', {
  agentContext,
})
console.log('Resolved DID Document:', result)
```

## Notes
- The method supports ECS (Entity Credential Schema) identifiers such as `ORG`, `PERSON`, `USER-AGENT`, and `SERVICE`.
- The function exits early if both `issuerCredential` and `verifiableService` are found during credential processing.

This method is essential for resolving and validating DIDs in a trusted ecosystem.
